## POST BODY (copy tutto da qui):

```markdown
**TL;DR:** Compared real costs across 5 major exchanges. If you trade €10k/month, your exchange choice costs you €137/month difference or €1,644/year. Here's the actual breakdown.

---

## Background

Frustrated with "comparison" articles that just copy-paste marketing material, I spent last week analyzing ACTUAL costs across major exchanges for the Italian/EU market:

- Binance
- Coinbase
- Kraken
- Crypto.com
- ByBit

## The Test

**Scenario:** €10,000 monthly trading volume  
- 50% BTC/EUR
- 30% ETH/EUR  
- 20% various altcoins

**What I measured:**
- Trading fees (maker/taker)
- Deposit fees (SEPA, card)
- Withdrawal fees (to wallet)
- Spread costs (buy vs sell price)
- Hidden fees (conversion, network)

## Results

| Exchange | Trading Fee | Withdrawal | Spread | **Monthly Total** |
|----------|-------------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| **Binance** | €10 | €2 | €3 | **€15** |
| **Kraken** | €16 | €3 | €5 | **€24** |
| **Crypto.com** | €40 | €5 | €10 | **€55** |
| **Coinbase** | €149 | €0 | €3 | **€152** |

**Difference:** Coinbase costs €137/month MORE than Binance = **€1,644/year** 🤯

## Key Findings

1. **Binance wins on pure fees** (0.1% vs Coinbase 1.49%)
   - BUT requires understanding of trading interface
   - More coins, more complexity

2. **Coinbase = easiest for beginners**
   - Incredibly simple UI
   - Best regulatory compliance (publicly traded)
   - You pay premium for simplicity

3. **Kraken = best middle ground**
   - Low fees (0.16% average)
   - Good UI + advanced features
   - Excellent customer support
   - Strong in Europe

4. **Spreads matter more than you think**
   - Crypto.com's "0% fees" is misleading
   - Wide spreads cost you €10/month hidden
   - Always check ACTUAL price vs market

5. **Your volume changes everything**
   - Small traders (€1k/month): Difference smaller
   - Large traders (€100k/month): Difference massive
   - VIP tiers change the math

## What About YOU?

Your best exchange depends on:

- **Trading volume** (€1k vs €10k vs €100k)
- **Coins traded** (BTC only vs 50 altcoins)
- **Experience level** (first time vs day trader)
- **Location** (EU regulations, US restrictions)

## Real-World Example

**Scenario: You buy €1000 BTC monthly**

**Coinbase:**
- Fee: €14.90 (1.49%)
- Total cost: €1,014.90

**Binance:**
- Fee: €1.00 (0.1%)  
- Total cost: €1,001.00

**Saved:** €13.90 per purchase  
**Annually:** €166.80 saved

That's a nice dinner! 🍕
