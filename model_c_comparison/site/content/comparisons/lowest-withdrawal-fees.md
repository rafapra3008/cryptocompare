        ## 🔍 Hidden Costs to Watch
        
        ### 1. Network Fees (Gas)
        Exchange fee ≠ total cost. Ethereum gas fees add €5-50 depending on network congestion.

        
        ### 2. Spread on "Free" Withdrawals
        Coinbase charges 0% withdrawal fee but has 0.5-1% spread. On €10,000 withdrawal = €50-100 hidden cost!

        
        ### 3. Minimum Withdrawal Amounts
        Some exchanges require minimum €50-100 withdrawals. Kraken: as low as €20.
