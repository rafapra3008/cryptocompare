If you're planning to trade frequently, lower fees save hundreds of euros per year.</li>\n            \n            <li><strong>Security:</strong> Look for 2FA (two-factor authentication), cold storage, and insurance. Kraken and Coinbase have the best security track records.</li>\n            \n            <li><strong>Number of Coins:</strong> If you want access to new altcoins, Binance (350+ coins) is better than Kraken (150 coins).</li>\n            \n            <li><strong>Ease of Use:</strong> Beginners should prioritize user-friendly interfaces. Coinbase wins here.</li>\n            \n            <li><strong>Regulation:</strong> All three exchanges are legal in Italy, but Coinbase and Kraken are more transparent about compliance.</li>\n\n            <li><strong>Payment Methods:</strong> Check if the exchange supports SEPA transfers (all three do) for easy EUR deposits.</li>\n\n            <li><strong>Customer Support:</strong> Kraken has the best support. Binance can be slow during high-volume periods.</li>\n        </ol>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"faq\">\n        <h2>\u2753 Frequently Asked Questions</h2>\n\n        <div class=\"faq-item\">\n            <h3>Are crypto exchanges legal in Italy?</h3>\n            <p>Yes, cryptocurrency exchanges are legal in Italy.
