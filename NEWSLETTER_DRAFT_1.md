## ✉️ EMAIL BODY (Version 1 - Welcome Email)

### Subject: 🚨 You're overpaying €137/month on crypto fees (fix inside)

```
Hey [First Name],

Thanks for subscribing to CryptoCompare Insider!

I'm going to be straight with you:

If you're trading €10,000/month in crypto and you're using the wrong exchange, 
you're literally throwing away €137 every single month.

That's €1,644 per year. Gone.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📊 Here's the breakdown I did this week:

Testing the SAME €10k trading across major exchanges:
• Binance: €15/month in fees
• Kraken: €24/month  
• Crypto.com: €55/month
• Coinbase: €152/month

The difference? A whopping €137/month between cheapest and most expensive.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

💡 BUT - and this is important:

"Cheapest" doesn't always mean "best for you."

If you're a complete beginner, Coinbase's simplicity might be worth paying extra.
If you're trading altcoins, liquidity matters more than fees.
If you're in Italy, SEPA support is crucial.

That's why I built detailed comparisons for different scenarios:

💡 TIP OF THE WEEK:

Most traders lose money on withdrawal fees without realizing it.

Crypto.com BTC withdrawal: €8

If you withdraw weekly, that's €416/year difference.
