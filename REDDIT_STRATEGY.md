**Target:** r/cryptocurrency (6.5M members)  
**Goal:** 500+ visitors, 50+ upvotes

---

## PHASE 1: RESEARCH (30 min)

### Top Posts Analysis

**Check last 30 days top posts:**
- https://reddit.com/r/cryptocurrency/top/?t=month

**Pattern recognition:**
- What gets upvotes? (Data, analysis, helpful comparison)
- What gets downvoted? (Spam, shilling, low-effort)
- Comment tone? (Skeptical but appreciative of value)

**Winning formats:**
1. **Data-driven:** "I analyzed X and found Y"
2. **Helpful guides:** "Complete comparison of X vs Y"
3. **Surprising findings:** "X is NOT actually cheaper (data)"
4. **Transparency:** "I built X, here's what I learned"

### Subreddit Rules Check

**r/cryptocurrency rules:**
- No referral links in post (OK in comments if asked)
- Must provide value (not just link dump)
- Original content preferred
- Flair appropriately

---

## PHASE 2: WRITE POST (60 min)

### Template Structure

**Title options:**
```
1. "I compared fees on Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken - Results surprised me"
2. "Complete breakdown: Crypto exchange fees in 2025 (Real data)"
3. "You're probably overpaying for crypto - Here's the math"
4. "Binance vs Coinbase: €137/month difference (Calculation inside)"
```

**Pick #4** - Most specific, most impactful number!

### Post Body

```markdown
**TL;DR:** Compared real costs across 5 major exchanges. If you trade €10k/month, your exchange choice costs you €137/month or €1,600/year. Here's the breakdown.

---

## Background

I've been frustrated with "comparison" articles that just copy-paste marketing material. So I spent last week analyzing ACTUAL costs across:

- Binance
- Coinbase
- Kraken
- Crypto.com
- ByBit

## The Test

**Scenario:** €10,000 monthly trading volume
- 50% BTC/EUR
- 30% ETH/EUR  
- 20% altcoins

**What I measured:**
- Trading fees
- Deposit fees  
- Withdrawal fees
- Spread costs
- Hidden fees

## Results

| Exchange | Trading | Withdrawal | Spread | **TOTAL** |
|----------|---------|------------|--------|-----------|
| Binance | €10 | €2 | €3 | **€15** |
| Kraken | €16 | €3 | €5 | **€24** |
| Crypto.com | €40 | €5 | €10 | **€55** |
| Coinbase | €149 | €0 | €3 | **€152** |

**Difference:** €137/month = €1,644/year 🤯

## Key Findings

1. **Binance wins on fees** (0.1% vs Coinbase 1.49%)
2. **BUT Coinbase easier for beginners** (UI, compliance)
3. **Kraken = best middle ground** (Low fees + good UX)
4. **Spreads matter more than you think** (Crypto.com hidden costs)
5. **Your trading volume changes everything** (Small traders → different winner)

## What About You?

Your best exchange depends on:
- Trading volume (€1k vs €10k vs €100k)
- Coins traded (BTC only vs altcoins)
- Experience level (newbie vs advanced)
- Location (some not available in US/EU)

## Detailed Comparison

I built a site with full breakdowns for different scenarios:
- Italy-specific regulations
- Beginners guide
- Bitcoin-only traders
- Low-fee champions
